<p>I am a PhD student at the University of Exeter, studying mathematical and computational neuroscience.  My research focuses on the dynamics of travelling waves on networks of spiking neurons connected with distance-based connectivity functions.  To explore model behaviours and test analytical results, I make use of event-based network simulation using GPU-parallelised code.</p>

<p>My PhD is supervised by Dr. Kyle Wedgwood and Prof. Peter Ashwin.  Within the University of Exeter, I am situated within the Living Systems Institute, a modern interdisciplinary building bringing together biologists, mathematicians and physicists under one roof.</p>
