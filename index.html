<p align="justify">I am a PhD student at the University of Exeter, studying mathematical and computational neuroscience.  My research focuses on constructing and analysing the dynamics of travelling waves on networks of integrate-and-fire neurons under lateral inhibition, considering the relationships between single-neuron and network-wide behaviours.  By making use of neuron models that are solvable between discrete input events, we can carry out event-based simulation parallelised for GPUs to rapidly and accurately explore and test analytical results.</p>

<p align="justify">My PhD is supervised by Dr. Kyle Wedgwood and Prof. Peter Ashwin.  Within the University of Exeter, I am situated within the Living Systems Institute, a modern interdisciplinary building bringing together biologists, mathematicians and physicists under one roof.</p>
